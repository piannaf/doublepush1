doublepush
===========

I first created two repositories, doublepush1 and doublepush2
with default READMEs generated by GitHub.

I then cloned doublepush2 then added a new remote with both URLs

    $ git remote add doublepush https://github.com/piannaf/doublepush1.git
    $ git remote set-url --add doublepush https://github.com/piannaf/doublepush2.git

When I tried to push a change to to doublepush using

    $ git push doublepush

It failed because the histories didn't match.

Since I first added doublepush1 URL to create the doublepush remote,
the doublepush1 URL was configured as both a fetch and push. Adding
the doublepush2 URL meant making it a push-only url.

```
$ git remote -v
doublepush      https://github.com/piannaf/doublepush1.git (fetch)
doublepush      https://github.com/piannaf/doublepush1.git (push)
doublepush      https://github.com/piannaf/doublepush2.git (push)
origin  https://github.com/piannaf/doublepush2.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/piannaf/doublepush2.git (push)
```

I could make this more robust by creating a seperate fetch/push remote
for both URLs, but since my origin and double push fetch from different
places, I'll leave that as it is.

So to merge the histories, all I needed to do was
    git pull doublepush

That resulted in a merge conflict since the default READMEs conflicted.

But now they are the same.

And I've confirmed I can push to both simultaniously with
    $ git push doublepush
